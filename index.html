			<h3>Who We Are</h3>
			<p>It's complicated and I don't wish to discuss it. It's none of your concern. You know what, let's just say that I have a hell of a lot more on my mind, right now, than thinking about buying a damn car wash. Okay? So if you could just... please. I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive?</p>
			<h3>What We Do . . . To You</h3>
			<p>It's enough. This is still the best way. You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive. But with this... you slip it into his food or drink, there shouldn't be any taste or smell... thirty-six hours later... poof. A man his age, working as hard as he does... no one will be surprised. Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be. Please, one homicidal maniac at a time. Stop. Stop! You keep saying that word - danger... danger! No and I have never used that word. I said things were complicated. And then you flew off the handle! </p>
